## Welcome to the coq-lsp test suite

The test suite is very preliminary for now, please help us to improve
it!

As of today we have one automated test-suite for the server, written
using `jest`, and a couple of manual tests, which should eventually be turned into `jest` tests.

```
/server     # automated unit tests for server functionality
/CoqProject # manual tests for _CoqProject parameters
/interrupt  # manual tests for interruption methods
```

We will document our `jest` setup and utilities soon.
