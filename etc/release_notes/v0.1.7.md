Hi folks,

it's been a while, but we are happy to announce a new release of
`coq-lsp`.

Install for Coq 8.17 and Visual Studio Code is as easy as:

$ opam install coq-lsp && code --install-extension ejgallego.coq-lsp

The 0.1.7 release has been focused on refinement and bugfixes; we'd
like to thank all the users and contributors for their feedback and
work, and in particular Alex Sanchez-Stern who did a large amount of
beta testing and tweaks.

Following a suggestion by Hugo Herbelin, we now follow a naming scheme
reminiscent of Isabelle's to distinguish the several `coq-lsp`
components:

- `coq-lsp` refers to the Coq LSP server

- `coq-lsp/Editor` refers to a particular client for `Editor`, such as
  `coq-lsp/Emacs`, `coq-lsp/VSCode`, or `coq-lsp/NeoVIM`.

This release also ships with some new features:

- `fcc`, the "Flèche Coq Compiler", an extensible, machine-friendly
  command line compiler that provides direct access to `coq-lsp`
  internal checking engine (Flèche). A very preliminary plugin API for
  Flèche is also available. `fcc` does understand Coq markdown files
  (`.mv`), produces errors and output in a machine-friendly format
  (JSON), can use the programmable error recovery mode from Flèche,
  etc...

- Coq Markdown files (`.mv`) are now handled as regular Markdown files
  in `coq-lsp/VSCode`, thus one can do live proofs and use standard
  Markdown mode commands like preview at the same time (contributed by
  @4ever2)

- The UI for error display was improved by Tomás Díaz.

- The goal panel now display information about open and solved
  obligations.

- `coq-lsp/VSCode` is now a web extension, and thus it will activate
  on `github.dev` and `vscode.dev`. The server has been refactored so
  it can run on the Browser context, full support is expected in the
  next release.

- A new notification for performance data has been added to server.
  A prototype panel displaying this data is now available for
  `coq-lsp/VSCode`.

We'd like to highlight some interesting third party contributions we
are aware of, and that could be of your interest:

- Bhakti Shah contributed support for her ZX Calculus Visualizer [2]
- Arthur Azevedo de Amorim started an Emacs client for coq-lsp [3]
- Pedro Carrott and Nuno Saavedra are developing a Python `coq-lsp`
  client [4]

# coq-lsp 0.1.7: Just-in-time
-----------------------------

 - New command line compiler `fcc`. `fcc` allows to access most
   features of `coq-lsp` without the need for a command line client,
   and it has been designed to be extensible and machine-friendly
   (@ejgallego, #507, fixes #472)
 - Enable web extension support. For now this will not try to start
   the coq-lsp worker as it is not yet built. (@ejgallego, #430, fixes
   #234)
 - Improvements and clenaups on hover display, in particular we don't
   print repeated `Notation` strings (@ejgallego, #422)
 - Don't fail on missing serlib plugins, they are indeed an
   optimization; this mostly impacts 8.16 by lowering the SerAPI
   requirements (@ejgallego, #421)
 - Fix bug that prevented "Goal after tactic" from working properly
   (@ejgallego, #438, reported by David Ilcinkas)
 - Fix "Error message browser becomes non-visible when there are many
   goals" by using a fixed-position separated error display (@TDiazT,
   #445, fixes #441)
 - Message about workspace detection was printing the wrong file,
   (@ejgallego, #444, reported by Alex Sanchez-Stern)
 - Display the list of pending obligations in info panel (@ejgallego,
   #262)
 - Preliminary support to display document performance data in panel
   (@ejgallego, #181)
 - Fix cases when workspace / root URIs are `null`, as per LSP spec,
   (#453 , reported by orilahav, fixes #283)
 - Pass implicit argument information to hover printer (@ejgallego, #453,
   fixes #448)
 - Fix keybinding for the "Show Goals at Point" command (@4ever2, #460)
 - Alert when `rootPath` is relative (#465, @ejgallego, report by Alex
   Sanchez-Stern)
 - Hook coq-lsp to ViZX extension (@bhaktishh, #469)
 - `proof/goals` request now takes an optional formatting parameter
   so clients can specify it per-request (@ejgallego, @bhaktishh, #470)
 - New command line argument `--idle-delay=$secs` that controls how
   much an idle server will sleep before going back to request
   processing. Default setting is `0.1`, using more aggressive
   settings like `0.01` can decrease latency of requests by ~4x
   (@ejgallego, @hazardouspeach, #467, #471)
 - Warnings from `_CoqProject` files are now applied (@ejgallego,
   reported by @arthuraa, #500)
 - Be more resilient when serializing unknowns Asts (@ejgallego, #503,
   reported by Gijs Pennings)
 - Coq's STM is not linked anymore to `coq-lsp` (@ejgallego, #511)
 - More granular options `send_perf_data` `send_diags`, `verbosity`
   will set them now (@ejgallego, #517)
 - Preliminary plugin API for completion events (@ejgallego, #518,
   fixes #506)
 - Limit the number of messages displayed in the goal window to 101,
   as to workaround slow render of Coq's pretty printing format. This
   is an issue for example in Search where we can get thousand of
   results. We also speed up the rendering a bit by not hashing twice,
   and fix a parameter-passing bug. (@ejgallego, #523, reported by
   Anton Podkopaev)
